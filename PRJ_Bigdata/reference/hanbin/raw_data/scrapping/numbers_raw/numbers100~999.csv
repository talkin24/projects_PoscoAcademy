nearly two centuries later, barnabas is inadvertently freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972, a stranger in an even stranger time. returning to collinwood manor, he finds that his once-grand estate has fallen into ruin, and the dysfunctional remnants of the collins family have fared little better, each harboring their own dark secrets.

family matriarch elizabeth collins stoddard is the one person barnabas entrusts with the truth of his identity. but his rather odd and anachronistic behavior immediately raises the suspicions of the live-in psychiatrist, dr. julia hoffman, who has no idea what kind of problems she's really digging up.

as barnabas sets out to restore his family name to its former glory, one thing stands in his way: collinsport's leading denizen, who goes by the name angie...and who bears a striking resemblance to a very old acquaintance of barnabas collins.

around the globe, headlines break the news: a scandal takes down an indian cotton tycoon; a chinese opium trader dies of an apparent overdose; bombings in strasbourg and vienna; the death of an american steel magnate... no one sees the connective thread between these seemingly random events - no one, that is, except the great sherlock holmes, who has discerned a deliberate web of death and destruction. at its center sits a singularly sinister spider: moriarty.

holmes' investigation into moriarty's plot becomes more dangerous as it leads him and watson out of london to france, germany and finally switzerland. but the cunning moriarty is always one step ahead, and moving perilously close to completing his ominous plan. if he succeeds, it will not only bring him immense wealth and power but alter the course of history.

a rich human drama plays out as lincoln doubles down to end the devastating civil war not merely by ending the war but by fighting to pass the 13th amendment, permanently abolishing slavery. it will be an act of true national daring. he will have to call upon all the skill, courage and moral fortitude for which heâll become legend. he will grapple with the impact of his actions on the world and on those he loves. but what lies in the balance is what always mattered most to lincoln: to compel the american people, and those in his government of opposite persuasions, to alter course and aim higher, toward a greater good for all mankind.
