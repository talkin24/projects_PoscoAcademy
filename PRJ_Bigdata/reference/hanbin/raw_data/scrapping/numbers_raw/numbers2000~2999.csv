in 140 ad, the roman empire extends all the way to britain - though its grasp is incomplete, as the rebellious tribes of caledonia (today's scotland) hold sway in the far north. marcus aquila arrives in britain, determined to restore the tarnished reputation of his father, flavius aquila. it was 20 years earlier that rome's 5,000-strong ninth legion, under the command of flavius and carrying their golden emblem, the eagle of the ninth, marched north into caledonia. they never returned; legion and eagle simply vanished into the mists. angered, the roman emperor hadrian ordered the building of a wall to seal off the territory; hadrianâs wall became the northernmost frontier of the roman empire - the edge of the known world.
 
driven to become a brilliant soldier and now given command of a small fort in the southwest, marcus bravely leads his troops during a siege. commended by rome for his bravery, yet discharged from the army because of his severe wounds, marcus convalesces, demoralized, in the villa of his uncle aquila, a retired army man. when marcus impulsively gets a young briton's life spared at a gladiatorial contest, aquila buys the briton, esca, to be marcus' slave. marcus is dismissive of esca, who harbors a seething hatred of all things roman. yet esca vows to serve the man who has saved his life.
 
hearing a rumor that the eagle has been seen in a tribal temple in the far north, marcus is galvanized into action, and sets off with esca across hadrian's wall. but the highlands of caledonia are a vast and savage wilderness, and marcus must rely on his slave to navigate the region. when they encounter ex-roman soldier guern, marcus realizes that the mystery of his father's disappearance may well be linked to the secret of his own slave's identity and loyalty - a secret all the more pressing when the two come face-to-face with the warriors of the fearsome seal prince.

jasmine arrives in san francisco in a fragile mental state,
her head reeling from the cocktail of anti - depressants
she's on . while still able to project her aristocratic bearing, jasmine is emotionally precarious and lacks any practical ability to support herself. she disapproves of
gingerâs boyfriend chili, who she considers another âloserâ like gingerâs ex - husband augie. ginger, recognizing but not fully understanding her sisterâs psychological instability, suggests that she pursue interior design, a career she correctly intuits that jasmine wonât feel is beneath her. in the meantime, jasmine begrudgingly accepts work as the receptionist in a dentistâs office, where she attracts the unwanted attentions of her boss, dr. flicker.

feeling that her sister might be right about her poor taste in men, ginger starts seeing al, a sound engineer whom she considers as a step up from chili. jasmine sees a potential lifeline when she meets dwight, a diplomat who is quickly smitten with her beauty, sophistication and style.

jasmineâs flaw is that she derives her worth from the way sheâs perceived by others, while she herself is blind to what is going around her.  jasmine earns our compassion because she is the unwitting instrument of her own downfall.

terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s, from pro-palestinian activism to the japanese red army.
he was at once both a figure of the extreme left and an opportunistic mercenary in the pay of powerful middle eastern secret services. he formed his own organization, based it behind the iron curtain and was active during the final years of the cold war.
this film is the story of a revolutionary internationalist, both manipulator and manipulated, carried along by the currents of contemporary history and his own folly. we follow him to the
end of his road, relegated to sudan where the islamic dictatorship, after having protected him, handed him over to french authorities.
a contradictory character, as violent as the times he embodies, carlos is also an enigma. that is what we set out to resolve, at least partially.
the film carlos has been made based on historical and  ournalistic documentary research. that said, the life of carlos includes significant uncharted periods, and thus is the subject of
controversy. this film is then, above all, a dramatization  etracing two decades in the life of one of the most notorious international terrorists of our time.

that's the good news.
the bad news is, the lottery claim office is closed for the long fourth of july weekend, so, before he can collect his prize, kevin is going to have to figure out how to keep a lid on his good fortune and survive the next three days.
as news of his windfall spreads through the community like a grass fire, kevin quickly discovers the good, the bad and the ugly in his closest friends and neighbors. girls who could never be bothered before start chasing him down. everyone wants a piece of him--including the reverend, the local loan shark and one very threatening recent parolee won't take no for an answer. on edge and on the run, he even begins to question the intentions of his best friend, benny.
he also starts to realize the power he holds in his hands and what this lottery ticket could really mean to him, his future, and the community.
it's funny what people will do when money is involved.
