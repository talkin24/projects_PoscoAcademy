however, everything changed on the gang's last job when jem briefly took a hostage: bank manager claire keesey. when they discover she lives in charlestown, jem gets nervous and wants to check out what she might have seen. knowing what jem is capable of, doug takes charge. he seeks out claire, who has no idea that their encounter is not by chance or that this charming stranger is one of the men who terrorized her only days before.

as his relationship with claire deepens into a passionate romance, doug wants out of this life and the town. but with the feds, led by agent frawley, closing in and jem questioning his loyalty, doug realizes that getting out will not be easy and, worse, may put claire in the line of fire. any choices he once had have boiled down to one: betray his friends or lose the woman he loves.
