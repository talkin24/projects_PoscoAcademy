when a fellow police officer disappears and boyle's small town becomes key to a large drug trafficking investigation, he is forced to at least feign interest when dealing with the humorless fbi agent wendell everett assigned to the case. left to run his territory to his liking for many years, he is not at all impressed when the fbi comes to town. everett looks down on boyle as a low-level provincial policeman with a limited and flippant view of the world; boyle sees everett as a by-the-book policeman with a chip on his shoulder and no understanding of how the real world runs.

 

despite the fact that boyle seems more interested in mocking and undermining everett than in actively working to solve the case, boyle finds that circumstances keep pulling him back into the thick of it. as unconventional as boyle is, these events unwittingly offend his murky moral code. he realizes that he needs to take matters into his own hands, and that everett is the only person he can trust. and so the scene is set for an unlikely friendship and explosive finale.

and into this world arrives their nephew, joshua 'j' cody. 
following the death of his mother, j finds himself living with his estranged family, under the watchful eye of his doting grandmother, smurf, mother to the cody boys. 
j quickly comes to believe that he is a player in this world. but, as he soon discovers, this world is far larger and more menacing than he could ever imagine. 
when tensions between family and police reach a bloody peak, j finds himself at the center of a cold-blooded revenge plot that turns the family upside down, and which also threatens to ensnare innocent bystanders such as his girlfriend, nicky. 
one senior cop, nathan leckie, must lure j into the police fold and then shepherd him through a complex minefield of witness protection, corrupt cops, slippery lawyers and a paranoid and vengeful underworld. 
j comes to realize that in order to survive he must determine how the game is played - he must somehow choose his place in this cunning and brutal animal kingdom. he must work out where he fits.

with the support of katyâs unwavering love and faith, and his own questions about what he may or may not have actually experienced, sol struggles to find meaning and purpose in the words let there be light.

with doctors and conventional medicines unable to provide a solution, joe turns to the only option left: the body's ability to heal itself. he trades in the junk food and hits the road with juicer and generator in tow, vowing only to drink fresh fruit and vegetable juice for the next 60 days. across 3,000 miles joe has one goal in mind: to get off his pills and get healthy.
 
while talking to more than 500 americans about food, health and longevity, it's at a truck stop in arizona where joe meets a truck driver who suffers from the same rare condition. phil staples is morbidly obese weighing in at 429 pounds. he is a cheeseburger away from a heart attack. as joe is recovering his health, phil begins his own epic journey to get well.
 
what emerges is an inspiring tale of healing and human connection. part road trip, part self-help manifesto, fat, sick & nearly dead defies the traditional documentary format to present an unconventional and uplifting story of two men from different worlds who each realize that the only person who can save them is themselves.
