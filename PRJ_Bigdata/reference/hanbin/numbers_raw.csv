nearly two centuries later, barnabas is inadvertently freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972, a stranger in an even stranger time. returning to collinwood manor, he finds that his once-grand estate has fallen into ruin, and the dysfunctional remnants of the collins family have fared little better, each harboring their own dark secrets.

family matriarch elizabeth collins stoddard is the one person barnabas entrusts with the truth of his identity. but his rather odd and anachronistic behavior immediately raises the suspicions of the live-in psychiatrist, dr. julia hoffman, who has no idea what kind of problems she's really digging up.

as barnabas sets out to restore his family name to its former glory, one thing stands in his way: collinsport's leading denizen, who goes by the name angie...and who bears a striking resemblance to a very old acquaintance of barnabas collins.

around the globe, headlines break the news: a scandal takes down an indian cotton tycoon; a chinese opium trader dies of an apparent overdose; bombings in strasbourg and vienna; the death of an american steel magnate... no one sees the connective thread between these seemingly random events - no one, that is, except the great sherlock holmes, who has discerned a deliberate web of death and destruction. at its center sits a singularly sinister spider: moriarty.

holmes' investigation into moriarty's plot becomes more dangerous as it leads him and watson out of london to france, germany and finally switzerland. but the cunning moriarty is always one step ahead, and moving perilously close to completing his ominous plan. if he succeeds, it will not only bring him immense wealth and power but alter the course of history.

a rich human drama plays out as lincoln doubles down to end the devastating civil war not merely by ending the war but by fighting to pass the 13th amendment, permanently abolishing slavery. it will be an act of true national daring. he will have to call upon all the skill, courage and moral fortitude for which heâll become legend. he will grapple with the impact of his actions on the world and on those he loves. but what lies in the balance is what always mattered most to lincoln: to compel the american people, and those in his government of opposite persuasions, to alter course and aim higher, toward a greater good for all mankind.

hoover was a man who placed great value on secrets - particularly those of others - and was not afraid to use that information to exert authority over the leading figures in the nation. understanding that knowledge is power and fear poses opportunity, he used both to gain unprecedented influence and to build a reputation that was both formidable and untouchable.
 
he was as guarded in his private life as he was in his public one, allowing only a small and protective inner circle into his confidence. his closest colleague, clyde tolson, was also his constant companion. his secretary, helen gandy, who was perhaps most privy to hoover's designs, remained loyal to the end...and beyond. only hoover's mother, who served as his inspiration and his conscience, would leave him, her passing truly crushing to the son who forever sought her love and approval.
 
as seen through the eyes of hoover himself, ""j. edgar"" explores the personal and public life and relationships of a man who could distort the truth as easily as he upheld it during a life devoted to his own idea of justice, often swayed by the darker side of power.

facing blatant racism from every side, even his own team, robinson was forced to demonstrate tremendous courage and restraint by not reacting in kind, knowing that any incident could destroy his and rickey's hopes. instead, number 42 let his talent on the field do the talking - ultimately winning over fans and his teammates, silencing his critics, and paving the way for others to follow.

in 1997, major league baseball retired the number 42 for all teams, making it the first number in sports to be universally retired. the only exception is every year on april 15th - jackie robinson day - commemorating the date of his first game as a brooklyn dodger. on that day alone, players from every team proudly wear the number 42 to honor the man who altered the course of history..

in 140 ad, the roman empire extends all the way to britain - though its grasp is incomplete, as the rebellious tribes of caledonia (today's scotland) hold sway in the far north. marcus aquila arrives in britain, determined to restore the tarnished reputation of his father, flavius aquila. it was 20 years earlier that rome's 5,000-strong ninth legion, under the command of flavius and carrying their golden emblem, the eagle of the ninth, marched north into caledonia. they never returned; legion and eagle simply vanished into the mists. angered, the roman emperor hadrian ordered the building of a wall to seal off the territory; hadrianâs wall became the northernmost frontier of the roman empire - the edge of the known world.
 
driven to become a brilliant soldier and now given command of a small fort in the southwest, marcus bravely leads his troops during a siege. commended by rome for his bravery, yet discharged from the army because of his severe wounds, marcus convalesces, demoralized, in the villa of his uncle aquila, a retired army man. when marcus impulsively gets a young briton's life spared at a gladiatorial contest, aquila buys the briton, esca, to be marcus' slave. marcus is dismissive of esca, who harbors a seething hatred of all things roman. yet esca vows to serve the man who has saved his life.
 
hearing a rumor that the eagle has been seen in a tribal temple in the far north, marcus is galvanized into action, and sets off with esca across hadrian's wall. but the highlands of caledonia are a vast and savage wilderness, and marcus must rely on his slave to navigate the region. when they encounter ex-roman soldier guern, marcus realizes that the mystery of his father's disappearance may well be linked to the secret of his own slave's identity and loyalty - a secret all the more pressing when the two come face-to-face with the warriors of the fearsome seal prince.

jasmine arrives in san francisco in a fragile mental state,
her head reeling from the cocktail of anti - depressants
she's on . while still able to project her aristocratic bearing, jasmine is emotionally precarious and lacks any practical ability to support herself. she disapproves of
gingerâs boyfriend chili, who she considers another âloserâ like gingerâs ex - husband augie. ginger, recognizing but not fully understanding her sisterâs psychological instability, suggests that she pursue interior design, a career she correctly intuits that jasmine wonât feel is beneath her. in the meantime, jasmine begrudgingly accepts work as the receptionist in a dentistâs office, where she attracts the unwanted attentions of her boss, dr. flicker.

feeling that her sister might be right about her poor taste in men, ginger starts seeing al, a sound engineer whom she considers as a step up from chili. jasmine sees a potential lifeline when she meets dwight, a diplomat who is quickly smitten with her beauty, sophistication and style.

jasmineâs flaw is that she derives her worth from the way sheâs perceived by others, while she herself is blind to what is going around her.  jasmine earns our compassion because she is the unwitting instrument of her own downfall.

terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s, from pro-palestinian activism to the japanese red army.
he was at once both a figure of the extreme left and an opportunistic mercenary in the pay of powerful middle eastern secret services. he formed his own organization, based it behind the iron curtain and was active during the final years of the cold war.
this film is the story of a revolutionary internationalist, both manipulator and manipulated, carried along by the currents of contemporary history and his own folly. we follow him to the
end of his road, relegated to sudan where the islamic dictatorship, after having protected him, handed him over to french authorities.
a contradictory character, as violent as the times he embodies, carlos is also an enigma. that is what we set out to resolve, at least partially.

smart, dreamy, independent and willing to stand up for what she believes in, juli is different from anyone else he knows and, frankly, it's a little overwhelming. what's a guy supposed to do when a girl tells him his hair smells like watermelon or wants him to sit in a tree for the spectacular view? there's just no telling what juli will do next, and bryce is one guy who'd rather be safe than sorry. 
though disappointed by bryce's unwillingness to see things her way, or even to see the things in life she finds most meaningful, juli continues to give her potential dreamboat the benefit of the doubt. until those doubts stack up so high that she finally thinks maybe she was wrong about him. 
it's just about the same time bryce starts to think maybe he was wrong about her, too. but is he too late?

when a fellow police officer disappears and boyle's small town becomes key to a large drug trafficking investigation, he is forced to at least feign interest when dealing with the humorless fbi agent wendell everett assigned to the case. left to run his territory to his liking for many years, he is not at all impressed when the fbi comes to town. everett looks down on boyle as a low-level provincial policeman with a limited and flippant view of the world; boyle sees everett as a by-the-book policeman with a chip on his shoulder and no understanding of how the real world runs.

 

despite the fact that boyle seems more interested in mocking and undermining everett than in actively working to solve the case, boyle finds that circumstances keep pulling him back into the thick of it. as unconventional as boyle is, these events unwittingly offend his murky moral code. he realizes that he needs to take matters into his own hands, and that everett is the only person he can trust. and so the scene is set for an unlikely friendship and explosive finale.

armed robber pope cody is in hiding, on the run from a gang of renegade detectives who want him dead. his business partner and best friend, barry 'baz' brown, wants out of the game, recognizing that their days of old-school banditry are all but over. pope's younger brother, the speed-addicted and volatile craig cody, is making a fortune in the illicit substances trade - the true cash cow of the modern criminal fraternity - while the youngest cody brother, darren, naively navigates his way through this criminal world - the only world his family has ever known. 
and into this world arrives their nephew, joshua 'j' cody. 
following the death of his mother, j finds himself living with his estranged family, under the watchful eye of his doting grandmother, smurf, mother to the cody boys. 
j quickly comes to believe that he is a player in this world. but, as he soon discovers, this world is far larger and more menacing than he could ever imagine. 
when tensions between family and police reach a bloody peak, j finds himself at the center of a cold-blooded revenge plot that turns the family upside down, and which also threatens to ensnare innocent bystanders such as his girlfriend, nicky. 
one senior cop, nathan leckie, must lure j into the police fold and then shepherd him through a complex minefield of witness protection, corrupt cops, slippery lawyers and a paranoid and vengeful underworld. 
j comes to realize that in order to survive he must determine how the game is played - he must somehow choose his place in this cunning and brutal animal kingdom. he must work out where he fits.

with doctors and conventional medicines unable to provide a solution, joe turns to the only option left: the body's ability to heal itself. he trades in the junk food and hits the road with juicer and generator in tow, vowing only to drink fresh fruit and vegetable juice for the next 60 days. across 3,000 miles joe has one goal in mind: to get off his pills and get healthy.
 
while talking to more than 500 americans about food, health and longevity, it's at a truck stop in arizona where joe meets a truck driver who suffers from the same rare condition. phil staples is morbidly obese weighing in at 429 pounds. he is a cheeseburger away from a heart attack. as joe is recovering his health, phil begins his own epic journey to get well.
 
what emerges is an inspiring tale of healing and human connection. part road trip, part self-help manifesto, fat, sick & nearly dead defies the traditional documentary format to present an unconventional and uplifting story of two men from different worlds who each realize that the only person who can save them is themselves.

the story is told through the eyes of tariq mahdi, a young man born and raised in a muslim household along with his younger sister taqua by their father hassan and mother safiyah. hassan is determined to send tariq to an islamic school to learn the quran, which safiyah strongly objects to. when hassanâs strict beliefs become too much for safiyahâs liberal nature, she decides that she wants a divorce. little do tariq and taqua know, the terms of the divorce are tariq is to live with their father and taqua with their mother. after the divorce, hassan fulfills his plans for tariq and sends him off to an islamic boarding school.

six years later, tariq is a freshman in college living back in the area he grew up. having been at the islamic boarding school and under the strict environment laid out by his father, tariq wants nothing to do with his islamic past. since the divorce, taqua has not seen tariq very often and their relationship has drifted apart. she decides to reach out to him and attempt to rebuild their once strong relationship. upon reuniting, she realizes that tariqâs attitude about islam has been heavily affected by his time at the school and with their father, so she tries to open him up to different ways of viewing his beliefs and incorporating his faith into society. 

unknown to tariq, his college experience is going to be beyond just academic enrichment. taqua starts spending time with him on campus and opening him up to new experiences. his roommate, hamza, is an arab muslim who also tries to reach out and connect with him but tariq constantly tries to avoid him. he also has interactions with a professor who challenges the students to think broadly about religion and world views, but the professor has to deal with the political ramifications from the dean of the department who is constantly trying to hold him down. 

just as tariq begins to grow as a person and open up to new ideas about his faith, the attacks on the world trade center take place. immediately, the view of muslims in america changes and some people begin to act on their anti-islamic feelings. their campus becomes an environment surrounded by violence and hate crimes. 

at that moment, tariq must make many critical decisions with his life, from dealing with a muslim/christian relationship he has with a young lady named ayanna, trying to deal with the views of islam that he knows while separating it from the ones created by 9/11, all while trying to protect taqua from the dangers building on campus due to that tragic day.

when the indonesian government was overthrown in 1965, small-time gangster anwar congo and his friends went from selling movie tickets on the black market to leading anti-communist death squads in the mass murder of over a million people. anwar boasts of killing hundreds with his own hands, but he's lived in his country with impunity ever since. when approached to make a film about their role in the genocide, anwar and his friends eagerly comply-but their idea of being in a movie is not to provide reflective testimony, but to dance their way through musical numbers, twist arms in film noir gangster scenes, and gallop across the prairies as yodeling cowboys. a cinematic fever dream, the act of killing presents a gripping conflict between moral imagination and moral catastrophe.

decisive victory nearly tripling its size with the occupation of
the west bank (including east jerusalem), the sinai peninsula and the golan heights. the nation brimmed with relief, joy and 
pride, while a new national narrative of manifest destiny emerged. but drowned out by the euphoria, other voices -many of those who fought the warâhad something different to say. one week after the conflict, amos oz and editor avraham 
shapira arranged to record conversations with returning soldiers about their experiences. in these intensely candid interviews they reveal their fears, their feelings about the enemy and their doubts about the treatment of arab prisoners of war and the forced evacuations of palestinian villages. the tapes capture these young men wrestling with the question of 
the responsibility of the conqueror to the conquered (even when the shoe could easily have been on the other foot), the paradox of a people who fled oppression who must now oppress to 
preserve their security and their still fervent hope for a lasting peace with their arab neighbors. the israeli defense force partially censored the recordings at the time but transcripts 
were turned into the book âthe seventh day: soldiersâ talk about the six-day warâ in 1970. now these newly available recordings form the core of this probing film as we see the former soldiers, now men in their seventies, listening to their younger selves. the recordings are juxtaposed with rare newsreel footage and photography of the conflict combined
with an evocative sound design that allows a unique opportunity to re-experience a war that changed the face of a region still locked in a deadly impasse.

in 140 ad, the roman empire extends all the way to britain - though its grasp is incomplete, as the rebellious tribes of caledonia (today's scotland) hold sway in the far north. marcus aquila arrives in britain, determined to restore the tarnished reputation of his father, flavius aquila. it was 20 years earlier that rome's 5,000-strong ninth legion, under the command of flavius and carrying their golden emblem, the eagle of the ninth, marched north into caledonia. they never returned; legion and eagle simply vanished into the mists. angered, the roman emperor hadrian ordered the building of a wall to seal off the territory; hadrianâs wall became the northernmost frontier of the roman empire - the edge of the known world.
 
driven to become a brilliant soldier and now given command of a small fort in the southwest, marcus bravely leads his troops during a siege. commended by rome for his bravery, yet discharged from the army because of his severe wounds, marcus convalesces, demoralized, in the villa of his uncle aquila, a retired army man. when marcus impulsively gets a young briton's life spared at a gladiatorial contest, aquila buys the briton, esca, to be marcus' slave. marcus is dismissive of esca, who harbors a seething hatred of all things roman. yet esca vows to serve the man who has saved his life.
 
hearing a rumor that the eagle has been seen in a tribal temple in the far north, marcus is galvanized into action, and sets off with esca across hadrian's wall. but the highlands of caledonia are a vast and savage wilderness, and marcus must rely on his slave to navigate the region. when they encounter ex-roman soldier guern, marcus realizes that the mystery of his father's disappearance may well be linked to the secret of his own slave's identity and loyalty - a secret all the more pressing when the two come face-to-face with the warriors of the fearsome seal prince.

however, everything changed on the gang's last job when jem briefly took a hostage: bank manager claire keesey. when they discover she lives in charlestown, jem gets nervous and wants to check out what she might have seen. knowing what jem is capable of, doug takes charge. he seeks out claire, who has no idea that their encounter is not by chance or that this charming stranger is one of the men who terrorized her only days before.

as his relationship with claire deepens into a passionate romance, doug wants out of this life and the town. but with the feds, led by agent frawley, closing in and jem questioning his loyalty, doug realizes that getting out will not be easy and, worse, may put claire in the line of fire. any choices he once had have boiled down to one: betray his friends or lose the woman he loves.
