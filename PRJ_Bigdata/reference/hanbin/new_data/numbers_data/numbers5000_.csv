the story is told through the eyes of tariq mahdi, a young man born and raised in a muslim household along with his younger sister taqua by their father hassan and mother safiyah. hassan is determined to send tariq to an islamic school to learn the quran, which safiyah strongly objects to. when hassanâs strict beliefs become too much for safiyahâs liberal nature, she decides that she wants a divorce. little do tariq and taqua know, the terms of the divorce are tariq is to live with their father and taqua with their mother. after the divorce, hassan fulfills his plans for tariq and sends him off to an islamic boarding school.

six years later, tariq is a freshman in college living back in the area he grew up. having been at the islamic boarding school and under the strict environment laid out by his father, tariq wants nothing to do with his islamic past. since the divorce, taqua has not seen tariq very often and their relationship has drifted apart. she decides to reach out to him and attempt to rebuild their once strong relationship. upon reuniting, she realizes that tariqâs attitude about islam has been heavily affected by his time at the school and with their father, so she tries to open him up to different ways of viewing his beliefs and incorporating his faith into society. 

unknown to tariq, his college experience is going to be beyond just academic enrichment. taqua starts spending time with him on campus and opening him up to new experiences. his roommate, hamza, is an arab muslim who also tries to reach out and connect with him but tariq constantly tries to avoid him. he also has interactions with a professor who challenges the students to think broadly about religion and world views, but the professor has to deal with the political ramifications from the dean of the department who is constantly trying to hold him down. 

just as tariq begins to grow as a person and open up to new ideas about his faith, the attacks on the world trade center take place. immediately, the view of muslims in america changes and some people begin to act on their anti-islamic feelings. their campus becomes an environment surrounded by violence and hate crimes. 

at that moment, tariq must make many critical decisions with his life, from dealing with a muslim/christian relationship he has with a young lady named ayanna, trying to deal with the views of islam that he knows while separating it from the ones created by 9/11, all while trying to protect taqua from the dangers building on campus due to that tragic day.

decisive victory nearly tripling its size with the occupation of
the west bank (including east jerusalem), the sinai peninsula and the golan heights. the nation brimmed with relief, joy and 
pride, while a new national narrative of manifest destiny emerged. but drowned out by the euphoria, other voices -many of those who fought the warâhad something different to say. one week after the conflict, amos oz and editor avraham 
shapira arranged to record conversations with returning soldiers about their experiences. in these intensely candid interviews they reveal their fears, their feelings about the enemy and their doubts about the treatment of arab prisoners of war and the forced evacuations of palestinian villages. the tapes capture these young men wrestling with the question of 
the responsibility of the conqueror to the conquered (even when the shoe could easily have been on the other foot), the paradox of a people who fled oppression who must now oppress to 
preserve their security and their still fervent hope for a lasting peace with their arab neighbors. the israeli defense force partially censored the recordings at the time but transcripts 
were turned into the book âthe seventh day: soldiersâ talk about the six-day warâ in 1970. now these newly available recordings form the core of this probing film as we see the former soldiers, now men in their seventies, listening to their younger selves. the recordings are juxtaposed with rare newsreel footage and photography of the conflict combined
with an evocative sound design that allows a unique opportunity to re-experience a war that changed the face of a region still locked in a deadly impasse.
