kind-hearted, fun-loving, and utterly without purpose, arthur spends every day in the heedless pursuit of amusement. but when his unpredictable public image threatens the staid reputation of the family foundation, bach worldwide, he is given an ultimatum: marry the beautiful but decidedly unlovable susan johnson (jennifer garner), an ambitious corporate exec who can keep him in line, or say goodbye to his billion-dollar inheritance and the only way of life he knows.

it's a deal arthur would be inclined to take...if he hadn't just fallen for naomi (greta gerwig), a new york city tour guide who shares his idealism and spontaneity. the independent naomi sees arthur not only for who he is, but for who he could be, and finally gives him a reason to take charge of his own life. 

all he needs to do is stand up for what he wants. but at what cost? 

with some unconventional help from hobson--the one person who always believed he could do anything--arthur will take the most expensive risk of his life and learn what it means to become a man.

hoover was a man who placed great value on secrets - particularly those of others - and was not afraid to use that information to exert authority over the leading figures in the nation. understanding that knowledge is power and fear poses opportunity, he used both to gain unprecedented influence and to build a reputation that was both formidable and untouchable.
 
he was as guarded in his private life as he was in his public one, allowing only a small and protective inner circle into his confidence. his closest colleague, clyde tolson, was also his constant companion. his secretary, helen gandy, who was perhaps most privy to hoover's designs, remained loyal to the end...and beyond. only hoover's mother, who served as his inspiration and his conscience, would leave him, her passing truly crushing to the son who forever sought her love and approval.
 
as seen through the eyes of hoover himself, ""j. edgar"" explores the personal and public life and relationships of a man who could distort the truth as easily as he upheld it during a life devoted to his own idea of justice, often swayed by the darker side of power.

facing blatant racism from every side, even his own team, robinson was forced to demonstrate tremendous courage and restraint by not reacting in kind, knowing that any incident could destroy his and rickey's hopes. instead, number 42 let his talent on the field do the talking - ultimately winning over fans and his teammates, silencing his critics, and paving the way for others to follow.

in 1997, major league baseball retired the number 42 for all teams, making it the first number in sports to be universally retired. the only exception is every year on april 15th - jackie robinson day - commemorating the date of his first game as a brooklyn dodger. on that day alone, players from every team proudly wear the number 42 to honor the man who altered the course of history..
